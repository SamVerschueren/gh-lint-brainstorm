# gh-lint-brainstorm

This repository is meant to brainstorm regarding a linter that lints repositories.


## What?

The idea is to lint repositories. This means, it will iterate over all your github repositories and will check the codebase for certain features.

This example shows some very basic linting.


## Brainstorm

If you have an idea, check if it is already suggested by someone else in the issue tracker. If not, create a new issue. Every idea is more then welcome, even a name...
